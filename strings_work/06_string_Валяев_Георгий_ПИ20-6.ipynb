<step>preparing dough for storage:</step>\n <step>warm the water slightly</step>\n <step>it should feel just a little warmer than body temperature</step>\n <step has_hours=\"1\">warm water will rise the dough to the right point for storage in about 2 hours</step>\n <step has_hours=\"1\">with cold water it will need 3-4 hours</step>\n <step>add the yeast to the water in a 5 quart bowl or , preferably , in a resealable , lidded plastic food container or food-grade bucket</step>\n <step>don't worry about getting it all to dissolve</step>\n <step>mix in the flour and salt - kneading is unnecessary</step>\n <step>add all of the flour at once , measuring it in with dry-ingredient measuring cups , by gently scooping up the flour , then sweeping the top level with a knife or spatula</step>\n <step>don't press down into the flour as you scoop or you'll throw off the measurement</step>\n <step>mix with a wooden spoon , a high-capacity food processor fitted with the dough attachment , or a heavy duty stand mixer fitted with the dough hook until the mixture is uniform</step>\n <step>if you're hand mixing and it becomes too difficult to incorporate all the flour with the spoon , you can reach into your mixing vessel with very wet hands and press the mixture together</step>\n <step>don't knead , it isn't necessary</step>\n <step>you're finished when everything is uniformly moist , without dry patches</step>\n <step has_minutes=\"1\">it takes a few minutes , and will yield a dough that is wet and loose enough to conform to the shape of its container</step>\n <step>allow to rise</step>\n <step>cover with lid</step>\n <step has_hours=\"1\">allow the mixture to rise at room temperature until it begins to collapse , approx 2 hours , depending on room temperature , and initial water temperature longer rising times , up to 5 hours , won't harm the result</step>\n <step>you can use a portion of the dough any time after this period</step>\n <step>fully refrigerated dough is less sticky and easier to work with than dough at room temperature</step>\n <step>on baking day:</step>\n <step>prepare your loaf tin , tray , or whatever you're baking it in / on</step>\n <step>sprinkle the surface of your refrigerated dough with four</step>\n <step>pull up and cut of a grapefruit-size piece of dough , using a serrated knife</step>\n <step>hold the mass of dough in your hands and add a little more flour as needed so it won't stick to your hands</step>\n <step>gently stretch the surface of the dough around to the bottom on all 4 sides , rotating the ball a quarter-turn as you go</step>\n <step>most of the dusting flour will fall off - that's fine , it isn't meant to be incorporated</step>\n <step>the bottom of the loaf may appear to be a collection of bunched ends , but it will sort itself out during resting and baking</step>\n <step>the correctly shaped final product will be smooth and cohesive</step>\n <step>the entire process should take no more than 30 - 60 seconds</step>\n <step has_minutes=\"1\">rest the loaf and let it rise in the form , on the tray / pizza peel , for about 40 minutes depending on the age of the dough , you may not see much rise during this period</step>\n <step>that's fine , more rising will occur during baking</step>\n <step has_minutes=\"1\">twenty minutes before baking , preheat the oven to 450f place an empty broiler tray for holding water on any other shelf that won't interfere with the rising bread</step>\n <step>dust and slash</step>\n <step>dust the top of the loaf liberally with flour , which will allow the slashing knife to pass without sticking</step>\n <step>slash a quarter inch deep cross , diagonal lines , or tic-tac-toe pattern on top using a serrated knife</step>\n <step>after a 20 min preheat you're ready to bake , even though the oven thermometer won't be at full temperature yet</step>\n <step>put your loaf in the oven</step>\n <step>pour about 1 cup of hot water into the broiler tray and close the oven to trap the steam</step>\n <step has_minutes=\"1\">bake for about 30 minutes , or until the crust is nicely browned and firm to the touch</step>\n <step>store the rest of the dough in the fridge in your lidded container and use it over the next 14 days</step>\n <step>the flavour and texture improves , becoming like sourdough</step>\n <step has_hours=\"1\">even 24 hours of storage improves the flavour</step>\n <step>this is the standard bread</step>\n <step>there are loads of variations - both savory and sweet -
